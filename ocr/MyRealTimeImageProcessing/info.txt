ndk-build clean
ndk-build -j9

for test mode edit the file:

JNI/multipleObjectTracking.cpp - line ~231/232 save_middle_class()

//re-mark/un-mark the call to test_ocr_pic_hardcoded() + the return;


/Users/albert/test/ocr/MyRealTimeImageProcessing/JNI/ImageProcessing.cpp - switch back to .jpg (.png is for test)

 //remove ( IMG_PATH.c_str() ) ;
